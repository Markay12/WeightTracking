## *Source/About*

My name is Mark Ashinhust and I am creating this program to eventually allow someone to track their weight and understand what they need for their own body. 

## *Todo*

The beginning stages will be messing with matplotlib and implementing the graphs. Then hopefully it can be ported to user input and lastly use something such as Flask to port this to front-end application.

- [ ] Implement MatPlotLib

## *Version 0.0.1
